/**
 * The `Specific` pair, after the seam, and the two things about it that needed a decision
 * rather than a recipe.
 *
 * **`tk.glucodata.Specific` is still on both flavours, on purpose.** The §4 recipe says to
 * rename a duplicate pair per variant; here that is impossible without paying somewhere
 * worse. `src/main` cannot name a class in `src/mobile` or `src/wear`, so the two same-named
 * classes are the only handle shared code has on the flavour. The alternative -- a per-variant
 * `Application` subclass -- needs `android:name` repointed in two flavour manifests plus
 * `tools:replace` against the main manifest, a mistake that only shows at runtime, and it moves
 * the registration out of `Applic.onCreate()`, which is the ordering that closed the
 * post-reboot window where forecast alerts fired on the two-point fallback slope. Same reason
 * `ui.AlarmActivity` is an allow-list entry. So each `Specific` is now a shim with exactly one
 * member, and [theShimDeclaresOnlyRegisterBridges] is what stops it growing back.
 *
 * **`useclose` was never variant state.** It looked like it: a `static final true` on the phone,
 * a mutable `false` on the watch written by `setclose`. It is a cache of a persisted native
 * setting. `Settings` writes the setting and restarts the activity, and `initbroadcasts()` made
 * a second copy at startup, so the cache had two writers and no owner. The contract now asks
 * the question directly -- `useCloseButton()`, the phone `true`, the watch
 * `!Natives.getdontuseclose()` -- and both the cache and its writer are gone.
 *
 * Source checks, as in GlucoseAlarmsAsymmetryTests, and every assertion quotes an anchor it
 * checks first. That is not ceremony: GlucoseAlarmsAsymmetryTests went stale under #469, and
 * this file was wrong four separate times in one session, every time by reading a partial
 * listing and reconstructing the rest from memory.
